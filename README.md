### **2.Matrix Inversion and Linear Equations**



Question: Discuss the use of matrix inversion to solve systems of linear equations.

Solution:

 





```python

```




```python

```


Question2:  Given the following system of linear equations:


```python

```
2x + 3y = 8
4x - y  = 7
```
Use Python and NumPy to find the values of `x` and `y` that satisfy these equations.


```


```python
A = np.array([[2, 3],
              [4, -1]])
B = np.array([8, 7])
X = np.linalg.solve(A, B)
x, y = X
```

Describe how matrix inversion can be used to solve the linear regression problem, and discuss any limitations or assumptions associated with this approach.

## 3. Linear Regression with Matrix Inversion

Question3:  You are working on a data science project where you need to perform linear regression to predict a target variable 'y' based on multiple features 'X1', 'X2', and 'X3'. Your goal is to use matrix inversion to find the coefficients ('theta') of the linear regression model. The dataset dummy_data.csv contains the following data:


```python
X1, X2, X3, y
1, 2, 3, 12
2, 3, 4, 18
3, 4, 5, 24
4, 5, 6, 30
5, 6, 7, 36

```

Write Python code to perform the following tasks:

- Load the dataset from dummy_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create a feature matrix 'X' by selecting the columns 'X1', 'X2', and 'X3'.
- Create a target vector 'y' by selecting the 'y' column.
- Add a column of ones to the feature matrix 'X' to represent the intercept term.
- Use matrix inversion to calculate the coefficients 'theta' of the linear regression model.
- Print the coefficients 'theta'.


```python

```
